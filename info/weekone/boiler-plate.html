                <h1>Hi My name is Jasmin. Welcome to my webpage!</h1>
                <p> Jasmin Rose Guerrera is a Canadian designer from Montreal, Quebec. She recently completed her undergraduate degree from Concordia University Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema with a degree in Film Animation. She then went on to work for the Concordia Film Festival's technical team where she was involved in DCP production and distribution. Jasmin also then worked at Spectrum Productions where she led her team to the creation of multiple films. She is now pursuing her graduate degree in Information Experience Design at Pratt Institute in New York City.</p>
                    
                <p>She believes in making comics, films and animations that will get an audience to react and to feel emotions strongly. Jasmin believes people remember the emotions they felt during a past event more than the event itself. Therefore, her main intention with her work is to get the audience to emotionally react as she believes that is the most memorable part an artistic process can evoke. Jasmin draws comics but has made and contributed to many other projects. Please see below her director's statement for her most recent film and some of her past works.</p>
