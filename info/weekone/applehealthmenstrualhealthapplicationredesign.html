<p><b><i>Apple Health</i>: Menstrual Health Application Redesign</b></p>
    <p><b>Overview</b></p>
    
<p>How might we redesign the Apple Health application for adult working women to be informed about their fertility cycles?</p>
<p>We aim to deliver an application that provides better and more diverse access to fertility information since this is a topic many women would benefit from in their daily lives.</p>

<h2>Design Considerations</h2></div>

<div class="triple-column">

<div class="design-box">
<h3>1. Efficient Tracking Method</h3>
<p>A more labour-saving tracking method for logging cycle information. This creates more accessibility and time efficiency.</p>

</div>

<div class="design-box">
<h3>2. Privacy and Security</h3>
<p>Mindfulness towards the lack of current laws protecting those with a uterus, and maintain full transparency with users about what happens to their data.</p>

</div>

<div class="design-box">
<h3>3. Health and Medical Accuracy</h3>
<p>Prioritizing reliable educational content that informs users about their cycle, symptoms and fertility predictions accurately.</p>

</div>
</div>



<div class=title-spacing>

 <h2>Research</h2>
 </div>

<h3>Primary</h3>

<ul>
    
<li><b>Inconsistent Tracking:</b> Users tracked their menstrual health by using apps, manual notes and or would forget to track it leading to accuracy issues.</li>

  <li><b>Healthcare Barriers:</b>Lack of available accurate medical information. Participants felt that menstrual health was not adequately addressed in medical settings.</li>


  <li><b>Privacy Concerns with Tracking Apps:</b>Participants were hesitant with sharing their
data on apps due to data security and third party sharing.</li>
  <li><b>Low Ovulation Tracking Awareness:</b>Ovulation tacking was less common. Some
participants expressed confusion about how ovulation tracking works.</li>
  <li><b>Gaps in Education:</b> Participants felt they lacked clear, reliable information about their
cycles, often learning through trial and error or informal sources.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Secondary</h3>

<ul>
    
<li><b>How Data is shared in Apple Health:</b> Apple encrypts all information from their health apps except for
one’s Medical ID.  Apple’ s policy is they won’t share one’s health data unless specifically requested by the user. </li>

  <li><b>Medical Data can be Shared Legally:</b> HIPAA, cannot stop data from applications, such as menstrual health apps, from being accessed. Law enforcement can access
this information as there are no laws against them using it currently.</li>


  <li><b>Equitable knowledge of Menstrual health and Fertility for all:</b>New York State has a
legislative package called Health Equity and Opportunity which requires women to have
equitable access to resources when regarding their reproductive health. Menstrual equity revolves around, not only
providing equal access to menstrual products, but also around having an equitable and unstigmatized education, 
about reproductive health.  More accessibility to fertility and menstrual health information allows for women
to have a better understanding of their overall body.</li>

 <h2>Feature Developments</h2>
 </div>

<div class="prototype-column">

<ul>
<li>A more <b>detailed calendar view</b>, offering users an at-a-glance summary of their cycle,
symptoms, and ovulation predictions. </li>
<li>A <b>dedicated Fertility Tracking page</b>, with tools that log ovulation,
pregnancy, fertility symptoms, and any related habits such as IVF tracking or temperature
charting.</li> 
<li>A new <b>Resources section</b>, that gives users access to medically-sound articles, tips related to fertility health and a section that informs users of how their data is being used.</li>

</ul>

<div class=prototype><img src="./portfolioimages/midfidelityprototype.png" alt="Mid-Fidelity Prototype Design"></div>

</div>




<div class=title-spacing>
<h2>Future Scope</h2>
</div>


    <h3>1. More Customizable Notifications for Tracking</h3> 

<p>
A more developed notification system to allow users to track their fertility cycles more
efficiently. This would include customizable notifications for IVF injection tracking,
different contraception tracking depending on the type of contraception or even more
specific notifications for ovulation tracking. Providing users with the ability to choose the
type of notifications they need to track their fertility is a feature to be further tested.</p>
    

<h3> 2. More Developed Mental Health Checks and Sections</h3> 

<p>Different and more detailed mental health checks that could suggest reasons as to why
a user may be feeling a certain way. These mental health checks could be further
researched and developed with psychologists or therapists in the field before being
implemented within the application.</p>


<h3>3. Medical Locations Suggestions Based on Insurance</h3> 

<p>More developed and thorough suggestions could be generated with a section allowing
users to upload their insurance options and what they can medically afford. Therefore,
when the application suggests medical locations nearby, it could easily suggest ones the
user can afford. It could also potentially let users know if there are medical locations
nearby that do not match their insurance as well.</p>

<h3>4. Discussion Boards</h3> 

<p>A place for users to discuss their questions with medical professionals and other users.
This could be a place to allow users to share experiences together, such as traumatic birth
experiences, or tips on how to balance work and a new family. It would also allow adult
working women to ask medical professionals questions if they have a hard time fitting in
a medical appointment in their busy schedules.</p>

<h3>5. Discrete Privacy Mode</h3> 

<p>A discrete privacy mode screen design would be a future implementation for women who
do not want to reveal they are using a menstruation application at work. People are
usually private with their medical data and not every adult working woman wants to let
the office know if they have an IUD or if they are trying for a child.</p>

<h2>Reflections</h2>
</div>

<div class="triple-column">
<div class="reflections-columns">

    <h3>What Worked Well</h3> 
<ul>
<li>Implementing Summary and Log tabs created a clear and easy-to-read layout.</li>
<li>Could visually see users’ clicking patterns which allowed us to receive valuable feedback to further adjust our redesign. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="reflections-columns">
<h3>What Did Not Work Well</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our observations did not match our design frame needs. Being within a medical space limited our ability to gauge behaviors since we could not enter past waiting room(s).</li>
<li>Users did not understand the subsections of the Health Resources Page. This seemed to be due to the vocabulary and how the options were named within our prototype.</li>
</ul>
