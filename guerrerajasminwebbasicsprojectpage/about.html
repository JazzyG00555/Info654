        Jasmin Rose Guerrera is a Canadian artist and filmmaker from Montreal, Quebec. She recently completed her undergraduate degree from Concordia University Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema with an undergraduate in Film Animation. She is now pursuing her graduate degree in Information Experience Design at Pratt Institute in New York City. She believes in making comics, films and animations that will get an audience to react and to feel emotions strongly. Jasmin believes people remember the emotions they felt during a past event more than the event itself. Therefore, her main intention with her work is to get the audience to emotionally react as she believes that is the most memorable part an artistic process can evoke. Jasmin draws comics as a hobby but has made aand contributed to many other projects.</p>
